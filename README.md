[![Azure AI Foundry Developer Forum](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Azure_AI_Foundry_Developer_Forum-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&color=adff2f&logoColor=fff)](https://aka.ms/foundry/forum)

### Session Description

Harness the power of real-time analytics and digital twins to achieve critical operational tasks. In this lab, you'll learn how to transform physical systems into dynamic digital replicas, enhancing simulations and optimizing operations. Discover how to build end-to-end solutions for event-driven scenarios, streaming data, and data logs. These practical steps will empower you to drive smart decision-making and foster innovation within your organization.

### ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

The sample data you'll use in this lab is a set of bicycle data, containing information about bike ID, location, timestamp, and more. You'll learn how to set up resources, ingest data, set alerts on the data, and visualize the data to extract insights.

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Create and configure a real-time event stream in Microsoft Fabric
- Ingest and query streaming data using KQL
- Build a real-time dashboard to visualize data
- Create a Power BI report from KQL query output
- Set alerts on event streams to monitor data changes

### ðŸ’» Technologies Used

1. Microsoft Fabric
2. Real-Time Intelligence
3. Kusto Query Language (KQL)
4. Power BI

## Business Value

- Be proactive instead of reactive with your data, thanks to Real-Time Intelligenceâ€‹.
- Show how businesses can get insights in Real-Time from their dataâ€‹.
